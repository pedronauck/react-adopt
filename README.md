## üßê &nbsp; Why

[Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) are the new hype of React's ecossystem, that's a fact. So, when you need to use more than one render props component together, this can be borring and generate something called a "render props callback hell", like that:

## üí° &nbsp; Solution

* **Small**. 0.7kb minified!
* **Extremely Simple**. Just a method!

React Adopt is just a simple method that you can compose your components and return all props in a function by mapping each child prop returned by your component.

## üíª &nbsp; Usage ([demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/vq1wl37m0y?hidenavigation=1))

Install as project dependency:

```bash
$ yarn add react-adopt
```

Now you can use adopt to compose your components. See above an example using the awesome [react-powerplug](https://github.com/renatorib/react-powerplug):
